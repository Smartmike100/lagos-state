<h1> LAGOS </h1>
Lagos, sometimes referred to as Lagos Stateto distinguish it from Lagos Metropolitan Area, is a state in the southwestern geopolitical zone of Nigeria. The smallest in area of Nigeria's 36 states,[7] Lagos State is arguably the most economically important state of the country,[8] containing Lagos, the nation's largest urban area. It is a major financial centre and would be the fifth largest economy in Africa, if it were a country.

The actual population total is disputed between the official Nigerian Census of 2006 and a much higher figure claimed by the Lagos State Government.

Lagos State is bounded on the north and east by Ogun State. In the west it shares boundaries with the Republic of Benin. Behind its southern borders lies the Atlantic Ocean. 22% of its 3,577 km2 are lagoons and creeks.
